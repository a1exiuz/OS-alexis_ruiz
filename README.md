Simulated Operating system 
My main.cpp simulates with delay the boot process.

i have a header file for my authenticater, i couldve done it without it but ive read its good practice to have a header 
for the source code of your function

my auth.cpp reads from a file that i provided authFile.txt. these are predetermined username and passwords and it will exit the program 
if the file is not able to be opened.
it will loop until there has been a successful login
